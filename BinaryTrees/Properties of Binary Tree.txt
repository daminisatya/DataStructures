=========================
PROPERTIES OF BINARY TREE
=========================

1. The maximum number of nodes at level 'L' is 2^(L-1)
2. The maximum number of nodes at height 'H' is 2^H - 1
3. For a Binary tree having 'N' nodes, the minimum possible height or minimum number of levels present are [logbase2(N + 1)]
4. A binary tree having 'L' leaves has atleast [log(L)] + 1
5. In Binary trees, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than the Internal nodes having two children.
6. Self balancing search trees like AVL, Red black trees.

Traversal algorithms
--------------------

Depth First Traversal
---------------------

1. Inorder Traversal ==> Left Subtree + root + Right Subtree ==> BST(non-decreasing order)
2. Preorder Traversal ==> root + Left Subtree + Right Subtree ==> Is used to create a copy of a tree, create a prefix expression.
3. Postorder Traversal ==> Left Subtree + Right Subtree ==> Is used to delete a tree, create a postfix expression.

Breadth First Traversal
-----------------------

1. Level Traversal ==> Level by level
